## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1\. Dynamic Dual-Mode Interface

  * **Toggle Control:** Easily switch between a compact **Standard Calculator** interface and the expanded **Scientific Mode** using the dedicated **"Sci"** button. The interface dynamically adjusts its layout and height using the `hidden` and `small-height` CSS classes for a seamless transition.
  * **Aesthetic Design:** The interface uses a vibrant, gradient background and buttons styled with an interactive, modern design that provides excellent visual feedback on press.

### 2\. Comprehensive Scientific Functionality

The calculator supports a rich set of mathematical operations, crucial for complex problem-solving:

| Function Category | Functions Available | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trigonometry** | $\text{sin}$, $\text{cos}$, $\text{tan}$, $\text{inv}$ | Calculates sine, cosine, and tangent. All trigonometric inputs are assumed to be in **degrees**, and inverse results are returned in **degrees**, ensuring practical usability. |
| **Logarithms** | $\text{ln}$, $\text{log}$ | Supports **natural logarithm** ($\text{ln}$, base $e$) and **common logarithm** ($\text{log}$, base 10). |
| **Advanced Math**| $\wedge$ (Power), $\sqrt{}$ (Root), $x!$ (Factorial) | Handles exponentiation, square roots, and the factorial function for non-negative integers. |
| **Constants** | $\pi$, $e$ | Precision constants for Pi and Euler's number are easily inserted into any expression. |

### 3\. Intelligent Expression Parsing (JavaScript Logic)

The core JavaScript engine is engineered for precision and user-friendliness:

  * **Implicit Multiplication:** The application automatically inserts the multiplication operator where mathematically implied, simplifying input (e.g., `5(2+3)` is parsed as `5*(2+3)`, and `9œÄ` as `9*œÄ`).
  * **Trigonometric Handling:** Sophisticated **Regular Expressions** are used to parse function calls and correctly apply **Degrees-to-Radians** conversion before calculation, ensuring accurate results for all trig functions.
  * **Robust Error Management:** Includes `try...catch` blocks and input validation to gracefully manage math domain errors (e.g., $\sqrt{-1}$, $\log(0)$) and syntax errors, displaying a clean `"Error"` message instead of crashing.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Full Keyboard Accessibility

For fast and efficient use, the calculator fully supports keyboard input, allowing for rapid calculations without needing to click the screen buttons.

| Key / Key Combination | Action Performed | Key / Key Combination | Action Performed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`0`-`9`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `.`** | Standard Input | **`Enter`** or **`=`** | Evaluate the expression (Equals) |
| **`Backspace`** | Delete the last character | **`Esc`** | All Clear (**AC**) |
| **`^`** (or `Shift+6`) | Power/Exponent function | **`!`** (or `Shift+1`) | Factorial function |
| **`p`** / **`e`** | Insert $\pi$ and $e$ constants | **`m`** | Toggle Scientific Mode |
| **`s`** / **`c`** / **`t`** | $\text{sin}$, $\text{cos}$, $\text{tan}$ functions | **`i`** | Inverse function ($\text{inv}$) |

## üí° Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

This project is actively developed. The following features are planned to be added to enhance its capabilities:

1.  **Memory Functions (M+, M-, MR, MC):** Implement standard calculator memory functions to store and recall temporary results.
2.  **Hypotenuse/Hyperbolic Functions:** Add buttons and logic for $\text{hyp}$, $\text{sinh}$, $\text{cosh}$, and $\text{tanh}$.
3.  **Base Logarithm ($\text{log}_y x$):** Implement a function for custom base logarithms beyond the current base $e$ and base 10.
4.  **Display History:** A feature to view the sequence of previous calculations and reuse results.
5.  **Dark Mode Toggle:** Introduce a theme switch for user preference and accessibility.
6.  **Radians/Degrees Switch:** Allow users to toggle between input/output in degrees and radians, instead of being fixed to degrees.

## üíª Tech Stack Deep Dive

This project is a testament to the power of vanilla front-end development:

  * **HTML5 (Structure):** Used for the semantic layout of the calculator grid and input display.
  * **CSS3 (Style and Responsiveness):** Utilized a custom font (`'Quintessential', serif`), vibrant `linear-gradient` background, and sophisticated **hover and active states** (`.hov`, `.key-active`) to provide deep user feedback and a premium visual experience.
  * **JavaScript (Logic and Interactivity):** The core logic relies on meticulous **DOM manipulation** and robust **Regular Expression** parsing to transform user input into a safely evaluable expression string. It's a clean, module-like structure built without external frameworks.
